# Final Project - Bike Share Trends

## Project Task
I'm going to look at data from Washington DC covering the years 2011 and 2012 ((London Set)) to look for trends between time of day, time of year and weather conditions to try and predict bicycle rental rates.

## Process
Found the Washington DC Capital bike share data set on [the UC Irvine website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset) via a list of interesting datasets. ((Also found the London set on Kaggle if I have time for it.))

Confirmed the same basic data was available in both datasets.

Explored data see distributions of various values, and to look for trends and possible correlations.

Performed feature engineering;
